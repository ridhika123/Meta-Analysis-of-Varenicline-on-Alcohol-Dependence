# Meta-Analysis-of-Varenicline-on-Alcohol-Dependence

## Abstract
* **Objective:** To assess the overall effectiveness of varenicline for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in adults according to three dependent variables: percent heavy drinking days, alcohol craving, and adverse events compared to a controlled study group.
* **Design:** A systematic review of found literature and meta-analyses of the data reported.
* **Extraction:** Percent heavy drinking days, alcohol craving scores, and the number of adverse events reported.
* **Conclusions:** The evidence implies the effectiveness of varenicline for reducing the percent heavy drinking days and significantly reducing alcohol cravings in patients with alcohol use disorders. Adverse events likely to occur include abnormal dreams and nausea, different from the ones presented by Chantix. However, due to the small number of studies, more meta-analysis is needed.

## Data
* Data are from ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, the Agricultural & Environmental Science Database, and the Biological Science Database.
